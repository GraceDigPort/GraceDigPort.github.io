    <h3> A Little About Me </h3>
    <p> I am in eighth grade and I attend the Rhoades School. This year my main focuses are improving my essay writing as well as doing my science fair project with my partner. Outside of school I am learning mandarin and attending martial arts classes at WCMAA. I also have a ~2 year old German Shepherd Puppy named Calla, like the lily.</p>
