     <h3>My Journey</h3>
      <p>I started Martial Arts, at West Coast Martial Arts, when i was 5 with my father. Through my eight years, I have supplemented my training with the other programs provided by WCMAA, including the studio's Demo Team and The SWAT Team, where I learn alongside older students to teach others Martial Arts. SWAT Team members are expected to assist and teach classes, with help from the STORM Team, and team of upcoming younger leaders who help around the studio and act as a helpers to the SWAT Team and instructors.</p>
